## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Greece is home of stunning waters, extravagant sites and beautiful locations. Athens is the largest tourist populated hot spot in Greece as it is the capital city. This dataset peaked our interest as we have plans to travel their one day and would like to understand the analytics behind the Airbnb listings. Understanding the most popular places in Athens will help us as travellers find the right place to stay. Learning the best prices, good review rates and type of home available will help us determine which listings are the most appropriate for what they offer. Since Airbnb is so commonly used worldwide it is to our benefit to recognize frequent rentals in each area especially in places where we plan to one day vacation. Due to the pandemic and restrictions slowly lifting the dataset can provide insight to how many bookings are being approved within the month of March. Thereby informing us if there are many tourist visiting during this time.    

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was provided by Airbnb, it is a dataset of rental listings in Athens. This data was collected on March 20th, 2021 within the last month. The purpose of this dataset is for public interest as it helps tourist know which places are the most popular and most likely to be booked. It also gives visitors knowledge of the place they will be staying at and the neighbourhood it is located in with the surrounding views. This dataset informs viewers of the hosts information with their response time, acceptance rate, if they are a super host or not and the number of listings a host currently has on the site. It also sheds light on the type of home one will be staying at, the pricing and availability of the booking. This dataset was compiled via server logs. With this dataset it creates a transparency between host and clientele.
